scripts
=======

This collection of tools provides a bunch of small and simple fully POSIX
compliant sh scripts making life easier.

Most of them show various system information such as audio volume, IP address,
CPU fan speed and more, which can be used in cojunction with programs like [dwm](https://notabug.org/kl3/dwm)
for example to build its status bar.
