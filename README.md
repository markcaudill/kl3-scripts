# scripts

This collection contains various helpers for obtaining system information such
as volume, IP address(es) as well as more advanced wrappers around frequently
used tools such as **tmux(1)** and **ssh(1)**. Where needed a small description
(incl. usage) can be found as comments in the scripts.

All scripts are written with portability in mind, that is only POSIX sh
compliant code is used. Where possible, system/environment agnostic tools or
ways are implemented to ensure that those scripts run on as many systems as
possible without any modification.

If you find bugs, logical flaws or simpler ways to accomplish certain tasks,
please let me know; I'll happily accept fixes or merge requests.
