scripts
=======

Most of them show various system information such as audio volume, IP address,
CPU fan speed and more, which can be used in cojunction with programs like [dwm](https://notabug.org/kl3/dwm)
for example to build its status bar, see `setdwmstat` for an example on how to
get a nice status bar for your window manager.

Every script is fully POSIX shell compliant and thus should run on any system
out of the box.
